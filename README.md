# hello-world

Hey everyone.

My name is Mike, and I created this github account to get a bit more coding/development experience. I just graduated from college with majors in IT Management and Economics, and most of my programming experience to date has been revolved around data analytics. I decided that I want to give software development a shot and potentially work in the field as my first real job out of college.
